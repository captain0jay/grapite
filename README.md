Grapite is a caching tool developed using Grafbase and Node.js. It provides a convenient solution for caching API responses, helping users save money by reducing the frequency of API calls. With Grapite, you can easily set up caching intervals for specific API requests, optimizing the way data is retrieved and updated.

## Getting Started

To run Grapite, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running:

   ```sh
   npm install
4. Start the development server with the following command:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

Now, Grapite is up and running locally.

## Usage

Access the Grapite API by opening your web browser and navigating to:

```
http://localhost:5000/grapite
```

### Endpoints

Grapite provides two main operations:

1. **GET Request**: Retrieve cached data from the API.

   ```
   GET /grapite/get/:apiname/:model
   ```

2. **POST Request**: Update the cached data for the specified API.

   ```
   POST /grapite/post/:apiname/:model
   ```

### Caching Configuration

To control the caching behavior, Grapite allows you to specify a time interval for updating cached data. This interval can be adjusted according to your needs, helping you strike a balance between up-to-date data and reduced API calls.
